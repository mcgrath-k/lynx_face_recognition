# Lynx Face Detection

##### Lynx Face Detection was built for the Xilinx 2017 Hackathon.
Using a constant feed from a webcam, the application recognizes when a face is present, and generates a feature set based on the image data. It will identify the face if it has been seen before, or create a new feature set.
