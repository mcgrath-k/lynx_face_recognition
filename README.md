# Lynx Face Recognition

#### Lynx Face Recognition was built for the Xilinx 2017 Hackathon.
Using a constant feed from a webcam, the application recognizes when a face is present, and generates a feature set based on the image data. It will identify the face if it has been seen before, or create a new feature set to recognize a face in the future.

This method is expandable to multiple boards. The feature set data is handed to a google drive database, where other boards can pull keypoints generated by other boards, and apply it to faces recognized.

Lynx Face Detection is built on the Xilinx PYNQ platform. All code is contained within a Jupyter notebook, making it easy to visualize.

## Run it on your PYNQ Board

Prerequisites
* Xilinx PYNQ Board
* Webcam
* Internet Access
* Monitor (optional)

Enter the terminal on your board and run the following:
```
cd /home/xilinx/
git clone https://github.com/x11kjm/lynx.git
```
Launch your jupyter notebook, enter into the GO directory, and launch the .ipynb file.

## How it Works
#### Face Detection and Cropping 
We use the Haar-cascade Detection in OpenCV method described here:
http://docs.opencv.org/trunk/d7/d8b/tutorial_py_face_detection.html

The algorithm applys Haar features to the feed generated by the webcam. A single value is generated for each feature by subtracting a sum of pixels under white rectangle from the sum of pixels under the black rectangle. This method is computationally light weight, ideal for the PYNQ board.

This returns an image with bounding boxes around the faces present in the webcam feed.

![Face Bounding Boxes](http://docs.opencv.org/trunk/face.jpg)

The face is cropped given the bounding box information.

#### ORB Feature Detection and Matching
The cropped images are handed to OpenCV ORB (Oriented FAST and Rotated Brief).
A list of keypoints along with their locations are generated on the image.

![Example Keypoints](http://docs.opencv.org/3.0-beta/_images/orb_kp.jpg)

A list of matches are generated by a brute force matcher. Similar images/faces will generate a higher amount of matches, which we use to score if we have seen the same faces before.
